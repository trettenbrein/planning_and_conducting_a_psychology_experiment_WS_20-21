Trettenbrein](https://trettenbrein.biolinguistics.eu) at [University of Leipzig](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/) in the winter term 2020-21.\n",

    "We already know about the basics of Python syntax and data types from the session last week, however, a key element of every programming language has been missing so far: Conditions and loops. These are vital because they allow us to only execute certain bits of code if a specific condition or conditions apply. On the other hand, loops make it possible for us to re-run a bit of code until a specific condition is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditions are invoked in Python using pre-defined keywords such as `if`, `elif`, and `else`. This follows the following logic:"

    "First we defined a boolean and named it `world_is_flat`. Then, we check the value of `world_is_flat` using an `if` statement. The code following the statement will only be exectued if the condition is satisfied. That is, if `world_is_flat` is `True` then Python will print the string `\"The world is flat!\"`. If `world_is_flat` is not true it will print the string `\"The world is not flat!\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already encountered the `is` operator last week. It does not only check whether two values are identical, but checks also whether they are the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can always use `not` to reverse the logic of our statement (i.e. instead of `world_is_flat is True` we could also use `world_is_flat is not False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in this case using `elif` and `else` will usually have the same effect: If `world_is_flat`is not `True` then the string `\"The world is not flat!\"` will be printed. This works here because `world_is_flat` is a boolean and may either be `True` or `False`. Yet keep in mind that we are not expliclty checking this here: That is, we only implicitly check whether `world_is_flat` is `False`. Therefore, it is generally adviseable to explicitly check a statement as the code for `else` will be run in every other case where the `if` statement is not satisifed.\n",
